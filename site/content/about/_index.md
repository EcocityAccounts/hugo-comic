## ABOUT ME

I'm a web designer/developer and comic artist. I've been making webcomics since 2000 when I started a strip for my university newspaper, and I've been developing websites since I realized I needed a place to put those comics. I've since made a career out of one of these skills, I'll let you guess which one.



## ABOUT HAMLET'S DANISH

The comic I am currently writing and drawing that's not about anything in particular. There aren't any recurring characters or story arcs. Each comic is its own encapsulated universe whose sole purpose is to deliver a single joke. Some of them aren't even really funny (those poor bastards). So far, it seems only pancake grabbing machines have been able to traverse the barriers.

## ABOUT ROB AND ELLIOT

A comic my brother, [Hampton](http://hamptonyount.com/) and I worked on from 2004-2012. It follows the exploits of two guys, but I forget their names. Hampton wrote it and I drew it.
